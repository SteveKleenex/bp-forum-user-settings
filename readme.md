* Currently, there are two options:
     * **Thread Display Mode** - Allows you to sort forum threads either by *Linear - Oldest First*, *Linear - Newest First* or *Threaded* (if threaded mode is enabled under bbPress).
     * **Number of Posts to Show Per Page** - Set the number of posts to show before pagination occurs.  Note: This option is only shown if threaded mode is disabled as at the moment, bbPress' threaded mode does not work with pagination.
